## Virtual Environment

If this is the first time running the code, create a new environment with conda. (You may alternatively want to use the `virtualenv` package; the commands will be slightly different.)

`conda create -n aoc`

Check it has been created, or, if returning to the code, check the environment is available with conda. 

`conda info --envs`

Activate the environment.

`conda activate aoc`

Install NLTK, jupyter, numpy...

`conda install nltk`

`conda install jupyter`
