I would like to spend all day waiting for him to kick. To lull when he lulls and attend when he is attentive. What would it mean to have nothing but creation? To steep myself in the way words can come from letters can come from movements of the hand and fingers. I would like to feel him being created inside me, just as I want to wait and watch and wait for the words, which might also come in regular intervals, which might also reveal a rhythm.

I try to live in Lispector's now-instant, whose mucused birth slips into departure too quickly. I am awake in the night. My breathing slows and then speeds. I conceive of the moment and it swims out of my grasp. I become fish and the moments slick by, I cannot stop moving. I am here and here and here. Fish become mammal become fish again. Whales and dolphins taking great gasps of air and then holding their breathe as if they could still breath water. I can no longer breath water. I am quadrant, rectangle, square, polygon. My moment becomes circle and then fractals out like pond ripples, concentric not spiral, the moments are this and this and this and they don't connect, not really.

I am breech born baby backwards, tending to this head I can feel just below my ribs. At my touch he may shift around, little bird inside me, unsure how to fly. He won't turn head down, instead kicks his bird wings into my pelvis. He has time but time shakes around, slowly sinks, will eventually go dry. Here is my first test: what I have created slides away from my controlling mind. I conceive and then the conception grows. Seed into sprout into nature's first green and suddenly the sun takes over and the weather does its chaotic work and genes unfold into a great expanding mess of creation.

I cannot quite conceive of having a child. I have shifty images in my mind of holding an infant, but they are worse than the dredges of a dream, they don't even have that strange logic behind them. They are flat. I am holding an infant. But what. What do I feel. What motion happens behind the stillness. The best poems are the ones where you don't know the ending. It's only in writing the poem does the poet get to know what the poem is about. This could be mysticism or muse, but it could also be discovery. Why do we have to think someone or something outside ourselves will hand us the answer? Perhaps I will create the ending out of bone and sinew. Perhaps I will create it out of angst and fear.

Soon, I will move. I mean, of course, I will get up, and brush my teeth, and go to the bathroom (again) but also, in the next month or so, we will find a new house, and move, and it will be hard and I will be reminded of how much stuff I have, and how so much of it I still love and want to keep even though I want to be free of possessions, or I want to want this. The baby is always with me, moving, and it (he) will move too, into a new place that is more ready for him and with luck and lifting I will be more ready too.

Is it okay to have children? I am halfway through A Children's Bible -- a novel, not a bible -- and the parents are idiotic, unable to deal with the consequences of climate change, taking ecstasy while the children escape with a groundskeeper to the countryside, although there is no real escape, there never is. Two of the younger children collect animals for an ark (it's a hurricane they flee) and they are right, in their small way: a good response to disaster is to remember creation. I know that words will not save us, despite a strong desire to arrange them just so, but the push towards a future that is, in some specific ways, new feels right.

It is stupid how amazing the ocean is. Swimming in water so salty you float. The lifting of weight. The shifting of tide. That great mosaic of white foam as the water reaches and slips over the sand or onto rocks. I love that pattern to death, have hundreds of photos of it, could stare at it for hours, the intricacy of it, its clarity, its constant motion. Ever shifting it remains recognizable everywhere I see it. I want my writing to be like that: not one thing, but a recognizable same, something you could look at again and again and keep seeing that sameness anew.

What will you do about gender? she asks, and it's a good question. What will I do about gender. Every time I tell someone the sex of this child they say something strange. Lucky, boys are closer to their mothers than girls are. Oh, girls are much easier to raise. I keep calling this thing I am creating 'it', because it does not yet feel human. I don't want to deny the humanity of what's within me, but I am not ready to acknowledge it as more than alive. It feels like a baby bird, flexing its wings and banging wildly against its cage. Do animals have gender?

No, that's a lie. It's my fear of what's ahead that plagues me. S and I sit on the floor and I try diagram out my anxiety. He makes a comment about probability and I tell him he's wrong, I explain that my chances each month are the same, the prior knowledge does not, in fact, change anything. Priors---a technical term in Bayesian statistics---legitimize the hope that the past can tell us something about the future. In this case, I suggest that every unsuccessful month may, in fact, indicate a more doubtful future. I haven't seen this modeled in any scientific paper I've found, but to me the math makes sense. Every month that does not succeed means your chances of never succeeding are just a little bit higher, because a long string of bad months are a prior for never finding success. But I know that I must simply wait for the tide to come in, and go out, and just sit at the edge of the sea for as long as it takes.

For long stretches of time I accept having to wait for the winds of chance to determine my fate. I feel unrushed. But then it descends on me: the panic of uncertainty, the fear of words like “never.” I try to avoid catastrophic thinking, but how to avoid my most central tendencies? Perhaps avoidance is the wrong way to view my worries. You don't break habits, you replace them. But I fear replacing worry with hope.

In Sydney I flirt with the sea. It buoys me, literally lifting the weight from my belly, I float perfectly and the waves shift and soften me, and I close my eyes and let the water do what it wants and I am rocked and slicked with salt. I should let life shift me like that, no fear that it may take me too far from shore. But of course even floating in the ocean has its own kind of anxiety; waves crashing over my mouth and nose, head hanging just a bit too far back, leaving me feel unanchored and exposed. Sometimes I shiver. Sometimes I suddenly flip because weightlessness hangs too heavy in my mind.

My baby is in breech. This fine, I am at 20 weeks, the baby has many months to turn head down, presenting himself ready for the great departure. And there is no shortage of advice about how to spin a baby, how to open the pelvis, how to situate the world such that change will occur. But my life has never been cajoled into specific shapes. These words will not go where I want them. I ache for peace but no amount of shifting of my hips will cure me.

My back has begun to hurt, the first sign that my body is rebelling against its changing form, or rather that conception is requiring new ways of being and I have not changed enough to match the change within me. Pain being mostly perception, being a kind of conception: we create pain when we expect it and can wish it away if we do not believe it is there. Which is not to say it is not real, only that its boundaries are porous and sticky.

In the Argonauts Maggie Nelson remembers being told that after giving birth (giving birth? giving it away? giving it a shot? giving it a gift?) she may find her work uninteresting compared to the depths of an infant---but not to worry, her curiosity about the world outside of her creation will come back. Will my writing shift, like scalding off the edges of my fingerprints? Like breaking a bone and setting it to be slightly longer? S, after breaking his collarbone, let it heal naturally, and now I can sit my chin in its divot, his new shape. But did it change him?

I remember reading Ann Lammot talking about the day her book is released. You expect something to happen, she writes, but very little does. That moment when the book turns into something that anyone can read, that moment you think it becomes real, is a small wave that lulls onto the shore and then retracts, leaving the bubbling of air from the mollusks and crabs. This is not what I've been told of birthing a human. Instead, the moment when a child goes from something within you to something without is, I am told, momentous. Still, I suspect that mostly we are made by the soft waves.

Bix Bouton in The Candy House is described as seeing a void ahead of him: no new idea is ready for him. That he may have already performed his one great act of creation disturbs him, and in the novel he walks the streets of New York City in anguish. The void for him is a white nothingness, until, in that precocious moment, it parts, and his future aligns with the conception of something new, and he has the power to create it, and it changes the world. Later, after his death, his novelist son lies fatigued in the snow, looking up at the white nothingness of the storm, and realizes that the void his father spoke of---the one that predisposed him to his next great act---is the tumbling, swirling conjunction of so many human lives (snowflakes), which at a distance lose their texture and turn into an apparent void. I'm stealing Jennifer Egan's idea here, but that's fine. In these characters she writes into existence two views of conception. Does she side with the novelist, or the technologist? I want to side with the void. I want to.

My memories dance and merge, pair off then threes and fours and then into singletons again. The gymnasium lets them echo. They don't know how to line up. There is before and after. There is the instant-now which is always just a way to create the after. But here the after is mucked up. The after conceives of its own before. You can re-order this, if you like. Or you can let the waves bring random particles in from the sea.

In The Vegetarian, by Han Kang, a woman turns into a plant. Or rather, she believes this: in the book, she ends up in a psychiatric hospital, refusing food because all she needs is light and water. There is another version of the story, in a short story Kang wrote, in which the woman really does turn into a plant, and her husband sets her outside on their porch, and eats the fruit that she blooms in the spring. I am starting to recognize I am not just one person. The kicks get stronger and come when people said they would: when I lay down, or after I eat. They come when I am in a work meeting, when I feel like a single person. I feel like I am living my life as just one. My transformation is on the horizon, the moment before even dawn comes, the moment when the light shifts and I think, Sure, yes, maybe if I put my hands flat on the earth at some point my fingers would turn into roots.

The ocean sweeps out and then back in. The surface breaks and cracks, fault lines of white foam netted out to the curve of the edge pushing up the sand towards me.

I am on the verge of tears. The edge of crying. I look over the precipice and it is no good out there, I'd like to stay here, where the emotions live behind the eyes, where I'm still able to walk to work and make myself dinner. I am overflowing. With what? With a lack of breath, with a fear of the future, with a desire to stay home, with a hope that the people close to me can hold me right, with a weight that bears down so hard on my ankles they swell at the elastic of my socks. Words should contain this much. Words should be on the verge, should look out over the precipice, should want so much more than they have to give. The best books end just after the words do. They hang around in the room with you, swiveled and swirling, that amorphous ghost they have birthed not ready, not quite yet, to leave.

Perhaps the words are not yet ready to be birthed. The metaphor is nice: the poem comes premature, or overdue. The poem creates a difficult labor, comes unexpectedly quick. The poem is in breech, or its chin won't tuck. My mother had seven children; she knew how to bring something into the world. What if I only write one poem in my entire life? What if I could not practice? Instead, I wash dishes for decades, watching the soap slick over my favorite mug, experimenting with sponges and scrub brushes and different temperatures of water. At the end, the poem comes out, and it is long but finite, and all I get to do is watch it grow.

Perhaps I should get some fish. Bring me closer to the ocean. Let me see their sleek and smooth corkscrews through the water. I don't dream of waterbirth but I do wonder. My dog sometimes seems like a dolphin, a watersnake, something too flexible and smooth for land, he head laying down flat on the ground in plane with his ribs, his body coiled like a dragon. Air gives us these sharp shapes: elbows, knees, ankles. Water seems to turn us velvet and sleek. The dolphins and whales---returning to sea after evolving on land---had to let go of knuckles and joints and right-angled hips. Fish seem closer to amoebas and cells. Wobbly, permeable, topologically sound. I am all angle and heat, but I want to remember that there's a way to swim through my life with just the tiny bubbles of air glossing off my surface.

We get our dog neutered. He comes home whimpering in the back of the car, then struggles to lie down in the bedroom, his back leg twitching, his head drooping. With the cone he is unable to push his head into my stomach, like he normally does in the morning when he's just woken up. Instead he stands sadly still, tail down. Eventually, he curls up the best he can. We take turns laying down next to him while he sleeps in fits. We were not sure that we should neuter him, but we decided to do it. Reasons, reasons. Fertility is not his future.

Conception being also the way we see the world. I conceive of a reader; you conceive of an author. We birth each other then, creating new creatures to hold up the edifice of communication.

Action grab and heavy stick. The new house is fresh but strangely dirty. I can't stop hearing the cars outside. I feel dread sink into me. I am all fear and sadness. That new is not better.

The new house is not these things and more expensive and located somewhere else and the road is busier I can't stop hearing the cars.

The patterns of the placemat refract strangely in the light; part of its intrigue is the interaction with the world. As if taking this book out of your hands changed its shape and texture. How will you imprint into the words? If every copy is different, then you hold some keystone of the arch, and you needn't know your neighbors but they exist, each imparting some idea of what this is into the heaviness of the intertextual ether. Taken together, all copies of the book file into a larger rhythm, but no one will read all copies. Mostly you will dip into this pool, and if you're lucky see the ripples intersect from afar.

Although the sun rises, the rain comes harder, and the clouds make dawn come evenly, that staticky grey of a cyberpunk horizon. The leaves are almost gone, just the occasional tree holding on to one last section of bright red or yellow. The rain will take down most of the remaining leaves, and we'll enter the period of waiting for spring. Already the magnolia tree outside my window has its buds and I don't know if this is normal or due to the strange warmth we get periodically as winter steps in to take the place of autumn.

To flip the baby they tilt me back, head below my feet, my uterus sliding, softly, up towards my ribs. I was told to come with a full bladder, to help push the baby out of the pelvis. The midwife settles her hand on my lower abdomen, pressing in to firmly cradle this creature's butt, and then asks me how long it took me to get to the hospital, while her hand gets deeper in me and starts to push. I am being changed from the outside in. I am being sculpted. I become sand, firm with water, and the midwife chats away, asking about my mother, and where I grew up, and my body is being formed differently now, and like any transformation it starts to hurt, at first just the discomfort of being manipulated like clay, and then the turgid turn toward actual pain, and I know now this baby is out of my pelvis, his butt moved up toward my belly button, and the midwife is chatty and I try to know my breath, the molecular feeling of air entering the nostril, one side always more sharp and cased in than the other, because I am not, in fact, viscous and wet sand but stubborn flesh aching back against this woman's determined grip, and we are fighting over the landscape of my belly, and the child is in the middle, silent, not even a slight rise in heartrate, and suddenly as the air moving into my lungs creases under burning of my middle, she says: It's done. Your baby is head down.

When I first started to collage, in the depths of a depression, what I loved was the surprise.

I am excited to return to the beach, where my whale belly can be lifted by the buoyancy of the sea. Where the salt can crust into my hair and my fingernails can remember the grit of sand and fleck of kelp.

I know that I will write a book and I know that right now that book is not within me. He says, and I have heard it before, that you should only write the book you have to write, the one that finds a nook within you and does not leave, will not go to sleep.

It is banal: to want to stop existing. The cloud lowers, and then the lightening comes, always in my wrists, a cold fire that licks up my forearms and down into my palms.

Still, they come, and I share them only to drench this work in honesty.

My body merges and then falls to pieces. Perhaps I am not myself, and even my body has become the accumulation of mere memory.

The analogy is poor. Who has died giving birth to their novel? What about obstetric violence, or the twilight sleep? To be unconscious throughout your creation. A drug which erases my memory but creates a book. I feel compelled to write to you, but does it kick inside me? Could it kill me? Does it have to come out no matter what?

There is no reason to enjoy Agua Viva. In fact, I cannot read more than one or two pages at once. I read the middle portion of it while in quarantine in a hotel during covid. I had only time, but the book does not invite enrapture. What does it mean to create something that pushes against you? Did Clarice Lispector want me to lose myself in her words? Or did she expect that we would tussle, that she would fight against my attention? I have always found her work calls out like a siren: beautiful, yes, but I know I should turn away.

My dog turns and turns and turns. Yes, I abandoned a friend. I was at my limit. I am at my limit. My dog cannot get comfortable. I walk home and feel the depression lowering onto me. Good friend who I cannot abandon. I know all the tricks but I still feel weak. My dog scratches at the couch. He will burrow a hole eventually. Hole in my mind and the leaky ooze of death slides in. I know creation is joyous. Sorry, joyless. I know.

The future remains blurred: a book, I guess, a child, I suppose. Fuzzy images without even the details of a dream, just tropes, cardboard cut-outs of a future life. I could never really imagine the future, the imagining breaking apart reality, or stifling it. But still there are times when I craft it carefully, a character in a novel being sculpted into a person you can talk to or predict, even though the character isn't real, you can't imagine it into flesh. Now, though, I enter another realm of creation, where I walk slowly, and buy the bassinet and put down the words and am not even all that present but simply look out ahead into the foggy distance which I get closer to with every step.

I keep forgetting. People talk to me and I am fully there, all mind, no body. There is no body within me. Human drama curls around my consciousness. I am pure empath. All talk. But the leaves become so red outside. Deep and pulsing, beating against the yellow and orange, cresting against the blue of the sky. The color sings and then, the shadow lifts. I am again a mass of blood and flesh. Creator of worlds.

I have crafted light out of glass. Source out of subject. Heat comes both from the center of the earth and from outside of its bounds. I am talking about stars, about the gaseous gurgling of newness. That it comes from both sides. That what is within me also comes from without. The muse and also the inner voice. The words and their reader.

Head down and the beast is calm, roiling around and throwing out his legs but never with malice or greed. Sometimes I sleep so well I wonder if labor is near, but there are no signs, and I nap during the day and I read at night about silence and quietude and the difference between the two. I am reminded of Terry Tempest Williams writings about and in Utah and the quiet of the desert and the time I convinced S we could camp in Joshua Tree without thick sleeping bags and it is still cold here but I can tell that winter in lifting I can feel spring is near even if I cannot tell if birth is.

Even if I stop writing the baby keeps growing. Keeps going. I try to mold him: sometimes I press on his head in hopes that a light touch will peel him from out of my pelvis and let him flip. This creation which I would like to flip upside down, which is really right way up, not yet ready for a smooth exit. My anxiety mounts because he will not turn, because my writing does not always come, because if I stop nothing will happen, I will stay still, my ideas will entomb themselves, and the baby will do whatever he wants and he needs no words or direction or touch at all.

The second anxiety is it's not any good. The words string together but don't light up. The child comes out wrong and mean. You put the book down halfway. You forget about it. You never return; it ends up on a stack to be donated and lives its life in a second-hand bookstore until some tired poet picks it up to use as collaging material. The words become mince meat. The child never gets on track. I don't even want to describe it, though I've seen it, the way a person can fall apart and no one can help them put the pieces back. Is it your fault? Did the chaotic tide turn luck and genius away from you, send its shivers down someone else's spine? The first anxiety is to create at all. The second, a crash.

The problem with the now-instant is the after. The after transfiguring into the radically new, as in dug out to its roots. I would like to plant seeds for the spring. I would like to become plant. Like The Vegetarian, I could stand upside down, spread my toes into leaves. But the snow weighs on me. I'm on the precipice of an after-now. How many things can I create at once? Or is it, how many things can I be?

I think I may abandon a friend. Can leaving be a form of creation? Leaving is not destruction, but it does create a gap, like when the space through which I just pass becomes freshly empty of me. When I leave this part of my life, when I enter into the other side, the hole of what I just was closes in around itself, a grand hug, but perhaps the lesson is that I can never be there again, it is impossible to look back, I can never know about this new creature, everything I create I must be blind to.

I must create myself anew. For one audience, I make my shadow round and smooth, the soft shapes of hills and moon. For another, I stretch out my fingers, bend at the elbow, and shift into the jagged surface of craters. I contort and twist. Each shape aims to appease a certain crowd, but I am blinded. The light assumes shapes around me, long shafts that putter with dust. It is wrong to say the shadow distorts or obscures. I am what I create. I am allowed to change myself.

I am working too much. I need to find the gaps in between. I get tired, then remember to eat. I forget to listen. I try to notice when the sun aches through the clouds. It aches so hard the colors become buoyant and hopeful despite the cold. I want to notice the change of seasons, so quintessentially American: I remember my first spring, in D.C., the way the flowers thrust and blushed into being, it was shocking, no one had planted them, they just erupted, the earth was ready. It was so different than where I grew up where it never got cold and there was no fall, nothing ever fell, and that meant nothing needed to reanimate, there was no rush of color when the heat came back and Persephone got to return to the sun.

When I return home I open my desk drawer and see my colored markers and collage scraps and phrases I don't remember cutting out from magazines: "rain in the," "layer upon layer," "alternating oscillations," "bows," "Hungarian-American," "the blueness of the sky," "storm, though near, is..." When I walked home from the train with my suitcase the sidewalks were wet but it wasn't raining, and it was dark even though it was just 5pm. I have returned to winter, and an empty house, and a bookshelf of books that I have mostly read. I almost cry at the thought of collaging and remind myself to give away my paints which I haven't used for years and many of which may have dried up. Yes, crying is easier now. It swells and spins and softens.

I planted my peppers late, and wrong somehow. They didn't grow as they did last year; the soil was too dense or too cold, the light insufficient, the seeds were old, the pots too wet or maybe too dry. By the time I realize they've stunted it is too late to grow again, the season moves swiftly, plants take time, I am no expert, instead I am messing around with these vegetables, forgetting them, losing my records, and they're small. All season they are small. The arc of the year makes for slow learning. I keep meaning to get better at this but the days drift into me before I notice their weight.

In addition to poetry, I write academic papers. A professor edits the paper draft and it becomes clearer but also starker, more crass. I hate the jagged face of that writing, the way the language turns its back on beauty. I want everything to be smooth. I want to hear the words follow each other in step. I want to see them shift in that slow dance of prosody. The paper I'm working on, I want it to be precious, I want the sounds of the words to matter. But they don't. And the professor and many like them shift my language towards something else, something I cannot control.

I want to invent something, but that is different than creation. Creation doesn't presume novelty. I am not inventing a child. At some point, at least a hundred years ago, invention meant "The action of coming upon or finding; the action of finding out; discovery (whether accidental, or the result of search and effort). Obsolete or archaic." An accidental finding, and maybe that finding was not new, or did not have to be new. Like p-creativity (creative to you) and h-creativity (creative to all, creative historically) we can split the world into mine and the one we both inhabit. Do I discover a child within me? Do I find out about it, the result of search and effort? Invention also being a "coming in, arrival" or "A short piece of music in which a single idea is worked out in a simple manner: a term used by J. S. Bach, and probably by him only, for small pianoforte pieces—15 in 2 parts and 15 in 3 parts—each developing a single idea, and in some measure answering to the Impromptu of a later day."

I tempt myself all day with sleep, even with the winter sun signing in through the window. My body stuck in an old timezone. Once I was told that my poetry manuscript needed more unique words: nap, siesta, doze, snooze, shut-eye, silence, home, sea, solitude, night eventually comes, early and dark, and I make lentils and miss my dog. I curl into a routine, even as I throw my most comfortable words into the bin and search for new ones. Words that haven't been leached of meaning; words that shiver and cling.

The words kick out with too many limbs. Army of creatures within me, obeying some alien lord. Some zeitgeber I have never experienced, or no longer remember, leads them into a chorus of action I cannot understand. This cannot be one thing, this thing with a life of its own, beating its own heart, folding up into its own shape. Topology of the fetus, deformation of the self, continuity of creation. He will not stay still, but he also will not go head down. I said once I too could put my hands on the ground and perhaps lift my feet upwards into the leaves of a tree. I shouldn't have said it so loud. This army of limbs keeps his head close to mine. Like a novel that just won't land.

I have this feeling that this moment won't come back. I want to live in this state of pregnancy as best I can, in case, after I leave it, it turns out I will never return. Pregnancy is hard but demands little of me. Writing is not scarce in this way, but perhaps the scarcity would help me live in it.

I want to labor this child out of me. A perverse desire to suffer just like all the people before me. I just want to know what it's like, even if I expect to not like it, or perhaps I want to prove that I am strong in some way that I doubt, or maybe I just sadistic, or maybe I want to labor everything out of me, refuse anything that could mollify the pain of creation. I am worried but not too worried because above the worry is curiosity and if only everything that caused me pain could also evoke wonder.

I am working too hard. It distracts me from the task of creation. I would like to focus on building a child, cleaving a book, but I'm so committed to these things beyond me. I can't stand the way the world surrounds me, brick by brick placing hours into locations and my thoughts draining out into the air. To contain myself is to sacrifice, in that every choice sacrifices all those other actions, as if my writing would improve if I could just give up on the rest. I was told to not have a child for this reason, the pram in the hallway, the way that life can sink you into the world so deeply you touch it with every inch of your skin.

Etel Adnan (a beautiful name, with such symmetric vowels) writes in patches about the sea, a wave that lost its way, the need to look at the Pacific before you die, how the sea has no arms to uplift the sky. Reading Sea and Fog is like meditating, just feeling the breath go in and out, the words themselves releasing their meaning lightly into the air. When I look up to check if I've missed my bus stop, then down again, the words have rearranged, I haven't read any of them, they're gone, vapor-like and flighty. Nothing in particular makes me want to keep reading, except perhaps the desire to sit in her words and feel her breath eking out over the water. If anything the words enervate me, letting my consciousness dip into something below structure and semantics, and I don't know if I even like the feeling, even if the patches have moments of clarity about climate change or a loss of love. What was she trying to create? Did it worry her, that her words weigh so little they slick off the page like bubbles, opalescent shimmer before disappearing completely?

Rachel Carson, before she wrote Silent Spring, wrote about the ocean. The way life buried in its mineral mix. The way it tossed life up onto the barren land, shoving plants onto the rocks. She never bows and calls the ocean a mother, but she nods at it as the source of all life.

It is a little life, I know that. Still, the creature growing inside me swizzles and swirls and knocks around like he is the first thing to ever grow. There is a line from Portrait of a Lady on Fire where she says, Do all lovers feel like they are the first to invent love's gestures? Maybe the line it wrong; it doesn't matter. Every act of conception feels like the first one. Clarice Lispector wanted to describe the now-instant; I am trying to tell you about the moment when something becomes.

The trope is that it's threadbare to write about childbirth, our most ancient and common history. Maggie Nelson said that labor was strictly quiet and my mother agrees it is an internality. The bookstore has its whole section on essays, literary criticism, writers looking in and on themselves and other writers, writing about writing, myself failing here too, fractaling down into the words, my own words, and childbirth is that shoreline that proved the point with fractals: the closer you try to measure the length of the shore, the longer it gets. It's this thing about the shoreline getting more and more detailed the more carefully you look. Perhaps this was Lispector's problem with the instant-now. The more you can pin down this instant, the larger it becomes, the less you are able to hold in your hand.

I keep a hold of myself. The sadness ekes in after stress, and after that comes the fatigue, or is it just the act of creation that slows me, makes me lie in the sun with my dog and let the light bungle its ways across my eyelids.

Let me try that again. I take my hands off the wheel. I wait to see where my life goes. I cure my anxiety by admitting that conception is nothing I ever got to choose. I relax. I look up at the sky; it's dark; the clouds and city lights block the stars; I squint at the nothing so it comes into focus; the edges of my vision sharpen; I see that the trees shape the blackness; I forget the stars; I move toward the horizon; I admit it: I don't know where I'm going. I have to try to not try. I have to look trying in the face. I have a staring contest with trying and of course I lose.

I am mid-cycle, but trying to forget it. S and I have a long conversation about sex while we run along the river, crossing one bridge and then another, put miles down into our shoes.

When I sit still, he comes alive, just as everyone told me. The little fish becomes bigger, and he writhes and turns, mystery within. I have created something uncontrollable. Your lyrics come out fast, and they hint at a feeling beyond touch. Or do they come to you slowly? Slip drip and the feeling is within you but hard to push out. This creature---a bird, a fish, a little dragon who hasn't yet learned of fire---already a puzzle box. I pull at the sides looking for where there might be motion. The lyrics are inside and you know how to pull them out, long thread of tangled thought. I write two things at once: the bird kicks of motion, and the need to turn feeling into language. It's useless because already the rolling across my stomach has turned to bubbles, to jabs, to the boops of a dog pushing his nose into objects to test their solidity. Here is the solidity: everything is changing.

The question I guess is if this creation will build. If there is structure that drags you along, an incessant child gripping your hand, eager and self-sure.

I'm trying to figure out why I am so against a c-section. At first it felt like I was being robbed of labor, but as it becomes more real and more likely it feels like I'm losing autonomy over my body. If I were hit by a car I wouldn't regret the surgery that made me whole again. But it doesn't feel like I've been hit by a car. It feels like I've been put out on the road and told to cross my fingers a car won't come. Had my feet and knees roped together, my hands cinched behind my back, and no one even offered me a blindfold. S has always said there are two options: you accept your situation, or you try to change it. But I don't accept it, and there is so little I can do to change it, and the changelings available are at odds and no one knows which change to hold onto and so I spiral into despair and worry about this flesh that I call my own and how it may be torn apart.

Already I project what this may become, how it may be received, as if before anything has existed it already lives a whole life as conjecture. I imagine you as enraptured or perhaps disappointed. I imagine myself as content or perhaps disturbed. It is hard to imagine a child, though, as I have no vision for this creative act, only that the process attracts me. Perhaps this is a better way to write: without goal, only an interest in the way the words might come out, ready to be surprised.

I can't beat the words out of me. Before the moment something exists, it burns. There are things you can do. Preparations, exercises, hopes. But sometimes the baby comes out upside down; there was nothing you could do. Backwards, words turn to snow: crystalline, yes, and filled with holes. The kind of creation that melts in your hand. You can't hold onto this.

I enter a cold as I finish a book on monsters. The monsters are artists---terrible men who rape and terrible women who abandon their children. The sickness lowers me. I spend days in bed and I feel bothered by my weakness amidst the geniuses who let their work subsume their lives. I will not be a monstrous mother, but perhaps I should consider it. Why won't I give up sleep for creation? Give up a career for greatness? My ambition wanes then waxes. I want one beautiful sentence. I will spend a lifetime on it. I will read Nabokov in his mystery. Hemingway in his cruelty. Carver in his drunken, downward state. Still I need sleep. Still I shy from these words.

I let the words sit still. Behind, a wave of cars and their staticky, tidal hum. I am no genius: there is no madness here. In madness I turn away from creation. I turn into myself. I lie very still. I close my eyes in hopes that I can remove the electricity from my mind and finally settle into the nothing of stillness. When I create, I must have a piece of contentedness within me: this satiation gives me the energy to work. Suddenly, a lack of hunger stagnates me. I am all contradiction which means: there is no madness here. I am no genius.

I am done writing. I am done with creation. The beauty of pregnancy is in fact there is little to do. Each day I grow slightly larger. My body feels slightly different. The subtlety is sublime. Whole hours go by where I forget I am pregnant. My mind accepts my new body, slots it into some new way of being. But to write: my fingers must move carefully, my mind must beget action. When I wake up, no more words have slid onto the page. This will not happen without me.

Lyn Heijinian dislikes the epiphanic poem. The one where the ending really hits, the poet having taken you on a ride and letting you feel the drop at the last line. The poems that lead you to a specific revelation. The theory is that this mode is closed, shutting down the possibilities of language rather than freeing the reader from guided thought. For a long time I wanted to write the perfect epiphanic poem because of its intense beauty and also the way it feels clean and right and so hard; it really felt like I had to have the epiphany with the poem, that I had to sneak up on the ideas that lurked beneath my own language, and then present my findings to you. Heijinian was the first person to suggest I needn't perfect the form, and that instead I could walk through the forest of words and stop someone entirely of my own choosing, at some perfectly and epiphanically random tree, and let you decide where to go next.

To flip the baby I go head down. I let the blood pulse into my eyes, try to soften my breath and belly. It is a grasping. A physical manifestation of hope. I balance on my forearms, my knees up on the couch. I envision this position as strengthening my shoulder muscles. I can only stay for a minute, maybe two. Then, I tire. I crawl back into my traditional posture, where my crown reaches up to the ceiling and my spine stacks down to my hips, aligned by gravity.

I've started to walk everywhere. Time moves more slowly, which is what I want, a kind of dilation of life, the absence of hurry. Walking sets the city into motion, and I get sight of its limbs and joints, its angles and curves. I walk in the morning when I can look at the sky as often as I like and watch the clouds and feel the sun even though it's cold. I walk in the in the evening when I mostly stare at the dark shapes of shadows on the concrete, and look out for potholes and the gravel of construction. I walk and I like to get there slowly, to commit to the commute, to notice where there are hills and where the ground lays out so flat it looks like it might go on forever.

I give up. I push it out like a child. The words come out bloody but breathing. I have conceived of nothing. I worried that I would not get pregnant. My cycles came short and quick and I bled lightly and I worried in what felt like without end as if some kind of end would release me. But anxiety tends to beget more of itself, a jellyfish that stutters back into its own larval state, or a tree released from life into its own seeds, or perhaps the mitochondria that sing their own song and create themselves anew, and so worry tends to give birth to more anxiety and as my cycles ended and I finally conceived of something I got to worry about new futures, like losing that which I had just imagined, or creating something I could not love. I guess I am trying to convince you that the anxiety of conception is never ending, a stream with no estuary, just continuously winding through the dirty rocks and dance of animals around it.

I start feeling nauseated around noon. Of course, it is strangely early for sicknesses, but I also know of distributions and long tails and the strangeness of statistics. The nausea builds. At 4pm I vomit in the hallway at work. Three explosions of watery internals. I make it home and vomit more. I take up my position on the couch and stay there for 24 hours. S commiserates and brings me crackers and tea but there is nothing he can do. Then, in the morning, it’s gone, replaced with weariness and weakness.

I decide these poems (are these poems?) must be numbered to preserve a history of their order. Order remains, for some reason, important. One step after another. Event and then, event. Not that this is how I remember. That moment I noticed a box of tampons on Angeline's wire shelf in her bedroom; folding a thousand cranes for Nina such that she could get her wish; the senior's room in the high school where we were not yet allowed; waiting at the bottom of the street for my dad to pick me up after public speaking; telling my mum I thought soccer practice was unnecessary and boring. Order exists only loosely, and mostly doesn't mind skipping a month or two or ten. I gave myself a year to birth a book. One step after another. Event and then, event.

I read a book narrated by a mountain lion. He overhears hikers from L.A. discussing their love life, and traffic, and a scarcity mentality, and how all these people are moving from New York. The lion is like a child, beholding the adult world but not really understanding it. The lion says 'ellay' instead of 'L.A.' The lion says 'scare city' instead of 'scarcity'. The lion doesn't understand the human world but also doesn't feel bad about this. The lion wonders but he does not worry.

I spend the holidays with my endless, growing family (parents, siblings, nieces, nephews, siblings' spouses' parents, etc.) accepting that I do am not as social as I want to be. I cannot endlessly entertain; cannot play host; cannot keep myself together like everyone else appears to do. There are those moments when the party moves around you. You become still and with that stillness you cease to exist. Or rather, you lose your place in the flow. Those moments make me want to cry and when I want to cry I want to disappear. Ironic: it is the feeling of disappearing that creates a desire to make it more concrete.

I read a book that makes me uncomfortable. I don't enjoy it. But I respect its ability to make me feel peculiar and crooked. Sometimes I think the best I can do is make you feel; the details don't matter too much. It's the temperature rise, or the stomach drop, or that sensation of lightness or hope or despair. Why else go into the imaginary world of words?

I am no single thing, though the words remain static and harshly angular, resisting my change. Clarice Lispector attempts to pin down the present moment, aches against her inability to convert the now and the this and the here into black-blue ink, to turn her thoughts into scratches that can inhabit my mind. She strives against herself, against me as her reader, she strives into her failing. But reading her again I am less sure. Maybe she writes like me, simply about the inability to cast any one thing into stone. These words shift beneath me, or rather, I am unsteady on them.

After I am told the baby has flipped I cry. And the midwife looks concerned but of course I am happy and shocked and when you get what you want there is this moment, it can be brief, where the anxiety disappears. The future holds still and the past loosens and suddenly you are breathing in just the fresh air of relief and it is clean and delicious and I am stumped, cut down to the quick, burning and alive.

To conceive of such a large mass as to forget about the edges, like the octopus with its distributed brain, each limb trusting that some other mind will coordinate the actions.

Ocean Vuong denounces writer's block---perhaps you are not ready to write---but my old poetry teacher, Erica Funkhouser, said that writing is muscle. Don't let it wither, she told me, as I embarked on a career as an engineer. You want to be ready for when the moment comes. Mary Oliver, too, suggests we write in meter and form as a kind of exercise, like weight-lifting to support your running habit, or painting portraits just to learn the technique. I was so bad at writing sonnets, couldn't get the rhythm right, clearly had the look of someone unprepared to tackle the dance of language.

Swollen ankles, swollen hearts. Talking about birth makes the tears reach up and out and into that cavity behind my eyes. I don't cry but the pressure is there, that heavy cloud of emotion, the weight of it, that thing that makes me speak carefully, or just keep it to myself, because words have always been a flighty vessel for tears. A coworker asked me about my emotions---this is something I worry about, she said, that it would affect my work, and I tell her with a laugh that mostly it's music that makes me want to cry, the Beatles have just become so beautifully heart-wrenching, but other than that I'm steady in the wind. I don't tell her that her question, its tender touch at the idea that the thing growing inside me is greater than myself, is changing me, will let the storm touch by my face, and that I will blink away this fog, this creep of overwhelm, that it's all so much, that everything is just so much right now.

I daydream about a job that gives me so much but would not give me writing. The anxiety of conception is its instability; we conceive before the world asks anything of us, and the world has asked so little of writers, we writers too eager to offer up our strange dreams. I want to sleep in the bed of creation, but I worry about my other dreams: computation, academia, health insurance. I feel blinded by my own station. I feel asleep at my own side.

I feel I am getting huge. I ask my friend who is a bodybuilder about stretch marks. I tell him I am embarrassed, because it feels so vain to worry about leaving marks on my body, as if this could happen and there might be no trail. We talk about collagen, and diet, and microneedling. The way that scars can heal. Oxymoronic. I have stretch marks on my back from growing too fast; my brother has ones to match. No one ever thought they were stretch marks; instead they looked like surgery scars, so thick and bulging. We used to joke that someone stole our kidneys in our sleep. Did we even grow that fast? If anything they tied us to each other, not to any sense of bodily evolution. The marks became their own object, their own kind of creation.

"While throughout the lower grades of intelligence, concrete objects and acts are reproduced in thought, and the imagination is thus almost exclusively reminiscent, the further development of the power of conception implies a continually wider range of thoughts, more numerous and more varied and involved."

There is a way in which I had hoped my life could come together before I had a child, like a cleanly wrapped present where the paper is just the right size and the folds are neat and tight. My mother warned me against this -- the time is never right, she said -- although I have seen it in others, who have done that thing where they marry and buy a house and have high-paying jobs and a room for a nursery. I have never wanted this, but I have wanted the stability of it, that false feeling of control, a way of putting bounds on my life that could make me feel safe. The alternative is a little looser, something beyond knowing, a trust or just hope that the path before me keeps going even though my ability to see far beyond my next steps becomes its own kind of box.

I can kind of feel my brain wisening up to its anxiety. Like, perhaps I am just feeling sad, and the object of the sadness would be something else if I didn’t have this particular anxiety in mind. I can feel the lightening. My perspective on reality shifts like a long pan in a movie: here I am from the left, but now here I see myself face on, then from the right, aspects hidden and revealed, the lighting changing my silhouette. I am no more one thing than the sea, who must change face on a dime, whose edges team with only the most robust kinds of life. I must be robust to my tides. I must remember my changing.

My body starts to rebel. My hips hurt when I sleep, I feel vaguely nauseated, I strain my groin, I hunger and then I don't, I wake up often in the night, I itch. My baby rebels too: he will not flip head down, will not let me labor him out like I had hoped. The anxiety of conception was, at first, a fear that nothing would ever come. Now it becomes the fear that what comes will not cling to my own hopes and dreams. What comes is wind and storm, tide and current. What comes comes on its own terms.

I hear it first. The rain comes down harder, and then harder still. I step out to the living room to see it and then, ignoring the conversation, outside onto the porch, where only a touch of water is blown into me. One step forward and I'm in the torrent. We're just past dusk and the sky retains a last hope of light. It is not just clouds above; the light peaks through; strange, right? The pummel of rain tempts me. I see myself stepping into it. I imagine my clothing wetted down to a clingy mat around me. I feel the chill of the wind against wet arms. I envision my siblings noticing and then commenting on my act. But I don't do it fast enough. The rain starts to slow, and then slow more. My moment has passed. No creation has occurred, or, I guess, the only kind of creation I am capable of.

I sign a contract: a promise to create. Conception already occurred, next stop is action. My wrists arc out, my fingers curl, and I have to remember to relax them, and suddenly nothing feels natural, how do I hold my hands? Sometimes I see my dad's hands shake and I worry about how this story will end. If it will crack or become tender. I keep thinking about beginnings when really loose ends slip away all the time. The anxiety of conception is about what may not become, instead of what no longer is.

A mood sweeps in like a fog. I no longer know where it came from. I get stuck in circles. I try to ignore the suspense; anger and hurt can do that well, but not entirely. Suspense is lodged within me, someplace deep. The fog crawls at my feet. Let me stay, it mews, and though I definitely want it to leave, it doesn’t feel entirely up to me.

Occasionally I feel out of breath. I'm lying down, or sitting, and I pull in the air through my nose as hard as a I can. I need something more from the air than it wants to give. I breath loudly. I breath in as long as I can. My midwife says my rib cage is expanding to make room, that this could explain the tingling I get under my left breast. I am getting bigger but also more compressed. I'm becoming denser. The air, however, is staying just the same. It swirls inside me and then leaves like nothing ever happened.

Sometimes I think there is a bird inside me, flexing and testing its wings. Settling down into a nest, perhaps, or waking up and stretching out its limbs. The jaggedness of it, the suddenness. The boniness. I read a book of short stories in which each character is pregnant with animal: sheep, horse, bird, raccoon. Jellyfish. Dragon. Sometimes the pregnancy is literal, other times it exists between reality and metaphor. What does it mean to conceive of something new? The book I think is really about longing. Or maybe it is about the strangeness of creation, the way it can push against what you or your partner or your society wants.

At the end of Infinite Jest, Don Gately wakes up on the beach, the water tiding onto his feet. It's the end of a disturbing sub-sub-sub-plot about addiction and revenge and pleasure and loyalty and pain, and unclear how much it relates to the major threads of the book. David Foster Wallace said he put the "real" ending just out of reach, just beyond the last page of his infinitely long book. It irked me, but I feel the desire to leave a story wide open, heaving through its gaps.

S drives through Arizona, almost in L.A. He sends me a picture of the desert, the flat bleached grass with a skinny band of sand slithering through its endlessness. In the distance, muted mesas, and above that the rich sapphire of sky, sparsed with white tendrils of clouds. Here in Boston the sky grows grey and trees are mostly empty, just a few dry leaves waiting to mark the end of fall. Soon I'll return to Sydney, and I can return to the blue of the ocean and its textured, turbulent surface that intersects with the sky.

Claire Dederer tells us that genius requires both that the artist break from norms and enter the realm of monster, as well as submit to the art itself. The genius, in pursuit of submission (restriction) towards creation, allows himself absolute freedom. In particular Dederer is concerned with monstrous behavior, but the

Which is to say, something suggested you spend time with these words. And the space between the words and your gaze is a scary one, because once it is closed there is no going back.

It is like a huge heartbeat in my gut, a single beat that comes at random times. Like a shift of food or bowels. Like an escape artist. Like a bulge. Like a bubbling. Like a leaf of the road that lifts and shifts just a foot away. Like the saccades of the women reading next to me. Something shifts but not like the waves of the sea, which cover the sand lightly, more like the white crest that doesn't ever crash, gets subsumed back into the blue of the wave. Not like the smooth turns of a bike wheel. Not like the branches thrumming slowly in the air currents. Not like the clouds which crawl across the sky. Not like that at all.

I imagine a poem that blooms like petals on a black bough but the words escape me and I want to know how much I am willing to give up to the machine. The internet asks why AI isn't doing tedious shit for creative people and instead doing creative shit for tedious people and it's the parellelism that we love because words which puzzle together perfectly feel more true than the ones that lay strewn across the floor uncertain they belong together. I recall the book of poems by the Australian author who spent time with researchers on the Great Barrier Reef studying the fish that clean other fish. Despite being prey/predators, there is a moment when the larger will not eat the smaller, in exchange for a kind of spa treatment. I'm not sure if the computer is the predator or the prey. Am I the cleaner or the big, dirty mess? Is it worth making a deal with someone who is trying to destroy you? How much of my life is about creating something good, versus eradicating something bad? Rebecca Solnit has good reasons for not having a child but she also thinks she doesn't need them. Similarly my reasons for having a child may be slim but why do I need to justify my desire to create?

Don Gately talks about the need not to survive long into the future. Instead, you just need to last one more second. Don't imagine the seconds piling into minutes standing up into hours which mount into days and corral, even, into months and then the gargantuan and olympic feat of years. Fools errand to survive for so long. No one could achieve such inhuman feats. Instead, last one more moment. Just this one. The next moment is for some other person, some other "I" you haven't even met yet. I meet myself at the junctions. Lispector's instant-now reframed for the anxious, the depressed, the addicted. The in-between bits where you hand off living to your future self. Will she be stronger than I am? Will she have learned some secret? I can either accept this or try to change it. I can either be or become. But really the instant-now requires moving through both. And I hate it. I tell you, I hate it.

I am being stretched. I fling myself against the wall of my own words. I crack open. I feel like a yolk. I simmer and then, shiver. I am trying to tell you something. My hands are planted. I strengthen my shoulders, my elbows, my wrists. Finally, my palms learn to shift my weight. Inside, I've become upside down. If it comes from within me, it must be of me. There must be a theme. I keep hoping that if I attend to his movements closely enough, I will learn something about him. That I can read his palms through my belly. But I am outside his world. Blind, deaf, and dumb to it.

Head down and it's true: he moves differently. For days I question the bulges under my right rib, rubbing raw the fleshy outcropping. Is this still a foot? Has he tricked me, swooped his head out of my pelvis at night, again pushing his crown toward my hand like an overeager dog? But no, this child, flipped and dipped and tripped into a new position by a midwife with large, strong hands seems, so far, so good, to stay in his new position, lowering down into that gap between my hips. One day a book may feel this way: settled and stable. But so far writing has remained liminal, not flesh and not ghost, unsure of what stasis could be.

The strange shifting motions within me could be anything. Gas, organ movement, whatever it is that creates the flutter of wings in moments of fear or joy or the soft space in between (which S says can be manipulated, i.e. one can change anxiety into excitement simply in the mind) but there is the obvious interpretation that thing within me is beginning to move in ways apparent to me. The uncertainty about the origins of this movement seem undiscussed. When asked, Do you feel it moving yet? the answer is always sloughed off into another question about what it means to know when something you are waiting for has truly arrived.

My friend builds little tools for poetry. Programs to shift the words around, websites that merge words or create new ones. She says the tools are in service of her writing, but can also replace the act of writing: the process becomes the product, the new way of creating subsumes whatever is created.

The rush is that there is no rush. The wind skids to a stop at the front door and the dogs howl at their station. I am hurtled toward birth but so slowly I feel every jostle. The doctors are unconcerned, bored even, at my fear. The anxiety of conception is not the lack of control, I've been lying to you. It's the lack of choice. I run toward a future I cannot control and I cannot stop running, I've never been able to, I always return to it despite all the problems it causes me. I run with the wind so it doesn't feel so strong. I rush so that I think I am the one rushing. I believe the doctors because how terrifying to admit that no one is making informed choices. No one is making choices at all.

I build the poem one word at a time. They come at random intervals, edging the poem into existence. I am interested in how words commune with each other, the way they bridge across the white space, ask questions of each other. Emily Dickinson didn't want to publish some of her poems, not wanting to create a canon, unwilling to part with her uncertainty. Was it anxiety? Or some higher theory, a belief that the poetry lives in our potential to be more than one thing at once.

Rain mixed with sleet mixed with snow. Described as “not great weather”. Described as “the snow storm was a bust”. Described as “garbage”. Described as “lucky” because the flight wasn’t delayed.

Will this make sense out of order? Will you try to recreate the events? Conception, early pregnancy, the moment I abandoned a friend, when the nausea came and went, the trip to Sydney, the baby hanging out in breech. As if the order keyed in to some narrative arc, lifting off the page and then softly settling back down. As if this book will have resolution. Will stop in a place of comfort.

Secretly I wonder if his loss of fertility will coincide with my gain. I am days away from the middle of my cycle, but I know that I'm playing a game of chance. This cycle I am using test strips, capturing a tablespoon of urine each afternoon and watching it draw purple lines on a thin strip of paper. So far, the correct hormone surge has eluded me, but the time is not quite right yet.

I cry for the first time in a long time. I am not sure if I am happy or sad. I imagine one of those emotion wheels, an array of feelings laid out in a circle, which always make me anxious because it seems too hard to really know how I feel when asked on demand. This is more like a breaking of everything. Like a surfacing. I am happy. And I am sad. And I am angry and grateful and scared and wondrous.

I coat and slick and shine and look for words I haven't shared before: excess satiation and the opprobrium of the masses. The couch a winery red matching his backpack. The pine needles twinkle in the morning sun, about 20 percent glittering its long-traveled reflection, the rest providing backdrop and texture. It's not that I don't want to be here; I do. I just want it all to go my way and when it doesn't, when the world and the people within it are chaotically in my way, I of course doubt my own walking and dislike the resulting tension even though I know I deserve nothing more than all I have ever received (a lot) and it's fine to be sad I know but is it fine sit in the unknown of wanting and rebel uselessly against it? This is no good; I'll cut it later. Cut it down or out or up, reframe my experiences in a new way, feel them differently, be thankful for those wooded paths I didn't take or wasn't allowed to or my good stable horse refused to walk down. But for now the thought of no trespassing gives me hives. Call it privilege or call it autonomy: we all deserve many options. My father always tells me nothing is certain; his parents lived through two world wars, survived Jewish and unable to talk about it. I live in their desperate shadow, which contains none of their details but the sharp outline of their emigration and assimilation. My feet touch only the ground, and my head edges towards the sky, and I am no tree, content to reach out roots hundreds of miles away. I want to plant myself. I want it. I do.

I want to slow down. I want to put one foot in front of the other. I want to feel my fingers at the keyboard and notice every key, the way it compresses down to its click. Sometimes when I sit down I just want to stay. The blood is moving through my veins. Come on, that has to be enough. The baby gets restless, kicks low in my pelvis and then, later, up by my belly button, above it even. Is that even possible? It's enough just to see the cream colored paint on the walls, just to hear the dog chewing on its bone, just to feel the tiny current of air over my knuckles. One foot presses lightly against the other. My head is being held up by my neck. My neck muscles must be so strong. I must be so strong to stay here and just stop and let it all be.

I am sorry I do not evoke Kirkegaard and some literary lineage of worry; instead I invite Gauss and his ideas about the "normal" distribution, and standard deviations, and medians.

I write to the sound of others writing. We sit in silence and I feel forced to find some words for the page because I have no where to go and no one else gets up and the light outside has up and left us.

I read a book that makes me feel. And I always think this is good: words that cause a temperature change, even if the shift tastes acidic or burned in my mouth. I feel like someone has touched an open wound, kindly and lightly, so it's not pain so much as disturbance, like being too aware of the blood in my veins, or losing the casing of my skin and feeling a shift of air over part of me never meant to be exposed. I am not sure one needs to enjoy a creation.

My rib cage needs to expand. My lungs soften. I can't quite figure out where my stomach is anymore. When I bend over, everything creases. I need to stand up straighter, pull my head back. Create space. S builds himself a new desk, quickly, and the wood grain doesn't match, and the screws show, but he built it fast and sturdy and heavy. I've become heavy too. Bulbous. The round object below my right rib, maybe four or five inches now in diameter, could either be his head or his butt, and I wonder all day about this. All day we make something new for ourselves. Food, friends, a stupid email. A series of words never been placed in that particular order. A series of actions you never once took before.

My placenta is bilobed, two pancakes separated by a small cord, two matching organs which should have been one. I am twice here. Once, watching the bird posed for flight, its head waiting for the sky to reach down. Once, pulsing blood throughout tiny tubes inside me, poised to fill some other creature with life. In the ultrasound it is clear: the even grey blobs are close but do not touch. The baby's head a mere distraction. But out here in the world the knowing is different. I know that something shifts within me. I know that my surface is thick and changing. I know that at some point separation will occur. I know that so much is happening without me.

Okay, so what I will do is have the computer learn the cadence of my words, the way one tends to come after another, the way phrases link up into sentences which link up into these little paragraphs I offer up like the tiniest of gifts. And then the computer will tell me which paragraph (let's call them poems, no?) follows which. How the poems connect into their own kind of dance which fractals out from the way I've joined the sentences and the phrases and the words. And something will come of this, something I didn't expect or even intend. Poems will dovetail together because their rhythm or sound slotted in just right. And you will conceive of this project differently because of it. Because something came out of me which I did not fully control.

The anxiety of conception is the loss of control. So let go. Take your hands of the controller. Lean back. See where this spaceship takes you. Slight vibrations shift the nose this way, then that. Think of the double pendulum, no, the triple pendulum, the chaotic spirals drawn through the air. I've become sensitive to starting conditions, the momentary stillness of the butterfly wing before the wind bucks up and you're not here anymore, you're somewhere else, you're drawing circles in the air, you're becoming the air, you're the atoms swept off the ocean, you're salt and water and minerals, and yes the ocean is warming up and yes she's rising to meet us and yes collective action is so hard we may not achieve it and yes this is a little life but there is a moment when you close your eyes and can just wait for the future to meet you on its own terms.

The dog looks like a rug and pounces on his toy as if it might get away, growls with it in his mouth. Maybe everything I'm looking for is staying very still and I just have to notice it. When I pause I want to stay that way. Opposite of the puppy who will spin and spin in excitement and in the patches of stillness seems only to recoil and get ready to set himself back in motion. Am I a spring also? Potential energy bound up within me. Vibrating with what could occur. Except really I feel energy seeping into the couch, my limbs lowering to their lowest point. The dog now chews on the bone with gnawing, scratchy gusto, you can tell he's over-eager. We are the poles, and in the middle some kind of balance that has left me.

Some of the color moves up the trees in waves, the top a shocking red while the bottom remains a grassy green. But others come mottled, the red and green splotched together like watercolor paints, each leaf a small canvas of merging. Sometimes a leaf changes all on its own, no concern for its jungled neighbors who haven't heard the call. A single leaf, or two, or ten, responding to some touch of air I cannot see or hear or smell. The air feels lighter now, the weight of summer lifting and leaving behind this vacant feeling, and the plants know something I don't, something about how to shed their skin and prepare.
