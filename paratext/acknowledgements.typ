Infinite thanks to Kyle Booten, who asked me to submit to taper and kickstarted my foray into computational poetry. 

Thanks to Allison Parrish, who talked to me before I had any idea what I was doing and even recommended my name to Kyle, and whose work and talks continue to be an inspiration. 

Thanks to Todd Anderson and all the folks who hang out at WordHack in NYC; what a great community to have been able to spend time with. 

Thanks to Maxwell Neely-Cohen, my guardian angel in New York, who also took me seriously before it made any sense. 

Thanks to Brambleberry in Cambridge for hosting me during the pandemic and beyond and teaching me what it means to live in community; many of these poems were written in that purple house. 

Thank you to Kathy Wu for tea and poetry and quiet conversations in the park; I feel at home when I talk about poetry with you. 

Thanks to Laura Zhang and Chris Knapp for our Cambridge writing group, during which many of these poems were written, and for being some of the first readers of these poems. 

Thanks to my blood-siblings, Anne Kim and Alan Romero-Diaz, for infinite moral support.

Thanks to Keyon Vafa for being my statistician-on-call. 

Thank you to Elena Glassman, who made sure I had a real maternity leave. 

Thank you to my parents, Mary Lou Maher and John Gero, who came to live with and support me during pregnancy, postpartum, and beyond, and have always gone out of their way to make creation easier for me.

Thanks to my dog, Topo Steven Gero Hughes; I'm sorry we cut off your balls. 

Thanks to Silas Hughes: for working with me on the ideas for this book, for holding me up in so many ways, and for making sure I had time to write. 

Finally, thank you to Jay Kepler, for bearing with me through the anxiety of conception.
